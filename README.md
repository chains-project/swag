## Chains sticker 001

The image is generated by the randomized algorithm available [here](https://github.com/chains-project/swag/blob/main/stickers/src/main/java/ChainsSticker001.java). The algorithm randomly selects a number of layers and connections between the layers in the software supply chain of a hypothetical project.

## Chains sticker 002

The image is generated by the algorithm available [here](https://github.com/chains-project/swag/blob/main/stickers/src/main/java/ChainsSticker002.java). It reads a [CycloneDX]() SBOM, extracts the sha-256 checksums of all dependencies in the SBOM. Each checksum is represented as a 'spoke' in the SBOM wheel. Each character in a checksum is mapped onto on element on the 'spoke', it is represented as a square or a line.
